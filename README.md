Proof of concept parsing HTML files to scrape data from the Michelin website.
This project originated from a desire to compile restaurant data for an upcoming trip to Tokyo and Osaka.
Thus, I learned to automate it by using the requests, xpath, html, and pandas library to compile all the restaurant data from the michelin website,
and input it all into an excel sheet.
